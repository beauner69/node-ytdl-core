What I do is:
* Clone the latest library into new spot
  cd /tmp
  git clone git@github.com:fent/node-ytdl-core.git
* Use filemerge to compare them
* Merge together the files:
    index.js - basically we only really need to maintain our exports to miniget replacer and the getfullinfo fn
    info.js
    sig.js
    util.js
    formats.js - When formats change you also need to check the format picker is choosing the right format itags.
* Only merge in what we need

Last update: 6 Feb 2020 - NOTE in the end we didn't publish this version, but it did work.

WRITE WHAT YOU DID BELOW:

UPDATE LOG 6 FEB 2020

index.js - Not merged, no significant changes
info.js - Updates to our two major functions. Cache ignored cos we don't use it.
sig.js - copied over except I kept our query[format.sp || "signature"] = sig;
util.js - Pasted new one in
formats.js  - Pasted new one in

UPDATE LOG 30 MAY 2020

Almost all of our key files were copied in. Miniget changed from callback to promises.

UPDATE LOG ~7 OCT 2020

Started trying to make it easier to merge by using /* */ instead of // to block out whole sections. Did a merge.

UPDATE LOG ~23 OCT 2020

Emergency situation. Fortunately our changes to make merging quicker sped up this merge. Modified miniget to match their new expectations to reduce code changes. Still need code changes in multiple places but it's not as bad. Tried to tag them all zerolabs but of course there are tons. Anyway got the shit done.
