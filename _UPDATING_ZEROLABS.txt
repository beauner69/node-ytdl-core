What I do is:
* Clone the latest library into new spot
  cd /tmp
  git clone git@github.com:fent/node-ytdl-core.git
* Use filemerge to compare them
* Merge together the files:
    index.js - basically we only really need to maintain our exports to miniget replacer and the getfullinfo fn
    info.js
    sig.js
    util.js
    formats.js - When formats change you also need to check the format picker is choosing the right format itags.
* Only merge in what we need

Last update: 6 Feb 2020 - NOTE in the end we didn't publish this version, but it did work.

WRITE WHAT YOU DID BELOW:

UPDATE LOG 30 MAY 2020

Almost all of our key files were copied in. Miniget changed from callback to promises.

UPDATE LOG ~7 OCT 2020

Started trying to make it easier to merge by using /* */ instead of // to block out whole sections. Did a merge.
